[Description]

There are N students in a classroom, which have the number from 1 to N. You will be given  N of relationships with your friends. ($ 1 \le N \le 14$)

In this classroom, they have a routine they use to pass on information utilizing their contact network. 

* First, Student 1 will receive the information. At this stage, no one except for Student 1 knows about this information.
* The person who received the information will choose **one of his friends** who has not received it yet with equal probability then deliver the info to them.
* This process ends when all of your friends learned about the info.

Please output the **average** and the **expectation** of the number of people to deliver the information.

Errors are acceptable when the value of absolute errors or relative errors are no more than $10^{âˆ’6}$.

[Solution]

As the number of students is quite small, the intuitive thought of the problem is using the search algorithms to get the final answer. However, it will take a long time if the students are all friends, and the time complexity is `O(N!)` which is not acceptable if N is greater than 10.

Consider this situation, the gossip has known by a set of students S, and already passed to student P (P is in the set S). We mark this situation as dp[P][S], and it's easy to find out that if we move from this situation to another ones. And we deal with these situations that which can't make a transition, the answer is right here.

It's a typical **dynamic programming** problem, and quite similar as the one to find the **Hamilton path**. The code is right here.
