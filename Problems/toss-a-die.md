[Description]
Consider the following game. The player tosses a die once only. The payoff is $1 for each "dot" on the upturned face. Assuming a fair die, at what level should you set the ticket price for this game?

[Solution]
### $3.5 of course.

This is just a warming up question.

This sort of question is common. Begin by caculating the expected payoff to the game. As usual, this is just the summation over the product of potential outcomes times their probability of occurrence:

$$
(\frac{1}{6} * $1) + (\frac{1}{6} * $2) + (\frac{1}{6} * $3) + (\frac{1}{6} * $4) + (\frac{1}{6} * $5) + (\frac{1}{6} * $6) = $3.50.
$$

If you are selling tickets to repeated plays of this game, you are effectively risk-neutral. This means you should charge the expected payoff($3.50) plus a margin for profit. You choose how wide to make the margin-it depends on your overhead, monopoly power, greed, and so on. You cannot charge $6.00 or above, since no one will pay. If the game is to be played only once, then you are risk-averse. You should charge the expected value, plus your profit margin, plus a risk premium. The risk premium depends upon how risk-averse you are.
